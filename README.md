# Tim Hey's — README.md

I created this personal README to help you get to know me and how I work. This document is inspired by remote teams around the world like [zapier](zapier.com), [buffer](buffer.com) and [gitlab](gitlab.com).

## About me

- My name is Tim Hey -- Currently, I am a Principal Product Manager on the Growth team at [Procore](procore.com). I'm focused on connecting everyone in the construction industry on one platform.
- I currently live in [Hilton Head, SC](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&t=h&z=12&vpsrc=0&mid=1Qtqlbz0hl78M8NRbzRCdgw_NnP0&ll=32.16264174527876%2C-80.74548800000001) 🇺🇸 with my wife Elizabeth, our 2 sons and our 2 dogs. I was raised in New Hampshire and that's where the majority of my family lives. I'm up there quite a bit in the summer months. 
- I’m an [introverted extrovert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion) which for me means that I enjoy spending time with others but I recharge in solitude. You will know which mode I’m in within seconds of interacting with me.
- I studied business management and sustainable product design and development at Keene State College in New Hampshire and it just so happens that is exactly what I’ve built a career around.
- I ride bikes 🚴‍♂️ and recently fell in love with gravel. If I’m feeling fit I will compete in local crits, gravel or cyclo-cross races. When I do compete I race for team [Mad Alchemy](https://www.madalchemy.com/). Feel free to follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2610245).
- I’m a podcast junkie, some of my favorites are [a16z](https://a16z.com/podcasts/), [My First Million](https://thehustle.co/my-first-million-podcast/), [All In](https://www.allinpodcast.co), [TrainerRoad](https://www.trainerroad.com/podcast), and [Rich Roll](https://www.richroll.com/).
- I recently took the Clifton Strengths assessment If you are curious you can learn more [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/growth/product/issues/797).
- Lastly, for more than a decade now I've lived a sober life and I'm very open about it, I won't lead with it but if you want to talk don't hesitate to reach out 📣

## How I work

- My timezone is [EST](https://time.is/ET)
- My working hours are 9am to 5:30pm with a 1/2-hour lunch break at 12pm.
- I block out 2-3 hours each day (in the morning) for [deep work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) 🎧
- I like to focus deeply on the task at hand, so I turn off notifications for email and Slack. Please expect my responses on email and Slack to be asynchronous. Your messages are important to me and I will respond as soon as I can.

## My typical week

- I use Monday's to advance deliverables, catch up with the team and address any blockers that may have popped up. 
- I have most of my meetings Tuesday - Thursday and like to keep Fridays meetings-free.
- Each Friday I prepare a plan for the next week ✍️

## My typical day

- I get up at 6AM on most days (if my children don’t wake me up first).
- I workout 4-5 times per week and try to do this between 7-8:30 AM but with 2 young kiddos I just grab what I can when I can 😉
- I start working at 9AM and take my first break around 12PM.
- I check my email in the morning around 9, after lunch at 1pm and again at the end of the day. This helps me be more productive during the day when I'm doing work. 
- I prefer to have meetings in the afternoon hours but will meet anytime during my normal working hours. 

## What’s keeping me busy

- I'm currently focused on the construction network project at Procore. Mainly standing up the first version of the web app and consumer facing pages. 

## How you can help me
* Do thoughtful, good work. Tell me if there's something preventing you from this, and we'll work together on fixing it.
* Default to action. Instead of waiting, move problems forward.
* Communicate. If there's a problem or you're blocked on something, please bring it up. I'll generally interpret silence as "everything's fine".
  * Don’t save urgent matters for a 1x1. Please bring them to my attention on Slack or by scheduling a separate call.
* Transparency is very important to me. Please default to using public channels.
* I like explicit asks. I’m better at helping when I have a good idea of what you need. “Take a look” is less helpful than “I’m looking for feedback on X and Y, by end of week”.
* Bring your whole self to work.

## What I assume about you
* Positive intent.
* You’re the DRI. You’re better at your job than I am! You know best, and you’ll tell me if there’s something preventing you from doing your best work possible.
* If I disagree with you, I may try to steer you down a different path. But me disagreeing with you doesn’t mean that you’re doing something wrong as long as you’re collaborating effectively with me and our teammates.
* You’ll ask for my input and help if it’s needed.
* Work is absolutely not the most important thing in your life. I assume that there are cherished relationships and personal interests that are more important to your happiness, and it’s hard to be happy with your job when work detracts from those things.

## How to reach me

- Slack - Direct message or mention is probably the best way to reach me during the day (my handle is @tim.hey). I will always have Slack open during business hours but I have notifications disabled on many of the channels so it may take some time before I respond. If you have an urgent message or need me to repond quickly the best approach is a direct message with a link or summary of the issue you need me to contribute to.
- <b>[E-mail](mailto:tim.hey@procore.com)</b> - I read my emails three times a day and work through them like a task list. If you have an urgent email please use [URGENT]: in your subject line so I see it. Please do not feel obligated to read or respond to any of the emails you receive from me outside of your normal hours.
- Meetings - You can schedule a 30 min "get to know ya" or "coffee chat" with you anytime - I really enjoy getting to know people and love helping as much as I can.
